```
compile 'com.github.aliabozaid.slick:Slick:0.2â€™
```

# Testing
Just run this command
```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```


# Usage
At first, your fragment or activity should extend **`BaseFragment`** or **`BaseActivity`** and implements the callback interface. 

The callback should contain your custom response. 

_**i.e:**_ In our sample,

**`IPlacesFragment`** extends **`IBaseFragment`** _(You can also use **`IBaseActivity`** in case of activity)._ 

#### Details
**`IPlacesFragment`** has the following methods:
```
void updateView(ListOfPlacesModel data);
 
void showError(Throwable t);
```

 **`getpresenter()`** should return an **`IPresenter`** object.
 
```
@Override public IPresenter getPresenter() {
    return presenter;
  }
 ```

Your presenter interface should extends **`IPresenter`**. Then, inject the presenter object inside Fragement or Activity.

```
@Inject IPlacesPresenter presenter;
```

Finally, use the interactor to handle the request from the data the server.
